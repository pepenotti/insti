# Plugin System

The plugin system is meant to allow people to create plugins to integrate their own features into the system.


## Plugin structure

Plugins must have the following structure:

- src (when required) - Contains the backend magic
- public (when required) - 

Plugins can be registered in two ways:

1- Adding the plugin on the Plugin Management site.
    - Upload the plugin-metadata.json file
